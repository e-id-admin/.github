# Deprecated notice

For the launch of the swiyu Public Beta Trust Infrastructure, we created a [new organization](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch) for all code repositories with [one place](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/community) for all topics related to community and governance. All new [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/swiyu-admin-ch/discussions) are now at organization-level with different categories for a better overview. In addition, we set up a [website](https://swiyu-admin-ch.github.io/) for the technical documentation, specifications, and cokbooks for the onboarding. We hope this will improve the user experience.

Please refer to the new organization - this space will be archived in the near future.
